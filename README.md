# 🌞 HTTP5121 Animation Project (CHECKPOINT)

## Project Idea

This project demonstrates a **day and night transition** animation.  
When the **door on the house** is clicked, the scene switches between **daytime** and **nighttime**.  
The sun and moon move across the sky, the background color changes, and stars appear at night.  
To make the animation more realistic, a **rooster** shows up in the morning and a **fox** appears at night.

## What I Used

- **HTML** → Page structure  
- **CSS** → Styling and animations  
- **JavaScript** → Controls the day/night switch  
- **Images** → Clouds, rooster, and fox  

---

## How It Works

1. Clicking the **door** triggers a JavaScript function.  
2. If it's **day**:  
   - The **sun rises**  
   - The **moon disappears**  
   - **Grass** is visible  
   - **Stars** are hidden  
   - The **rooster** bounces to show it's crowing  

3. If it's **night**:  
   - The **moon rises**  
   - The **sun disappears**  
   - **Stars** appear  
   - **Grass** hides  
   - The **fox** walks across the screen

## Animations

- 🌞 **Sun & Moon:** Move up and down using CSS `@keyframes`  
- ☁️ **Clouds:** Float smoothly across the sky  
- 🐓 **Rooster:** Bounces to simulate crowing in the morning  
- 🦊 **Fox:** Walks from one side of the screen to the other at night
