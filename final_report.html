        <h2>Document Overview</h2>
        <p>This document describes a test plan for conducting a usability test during the development of <span
                class="fill-in" id="website">Day & Night Garden — CSS Animation</span> and report of the results.
            The goals of usability testing include establishing a baseline of user performance, establishing and
            validating user performance measures, and identifying potential design concerns to be addressed in order to
            improve the efficiency, productivity, and end-user satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="fill-in" id="goals">The main goals are to understand how easily users discover interactive elements,
            identify confusion points, and measure how intuitive the animations feel for first-time users.
        </p>

        <p>The usability test objectives are:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>To determine design inconsistencies and usability problem areas within the user interface and content
                areas. Potential sources of error may include:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Navigation errors – failure to locate functions, excessive keystrokes to complete a function,
                        failure to follow recommended screen flow.</li>
                    <li>Presentation errors – failure to locate and properly act upon desired information in screens,
                        selection errors due to labeling ambiguities.</li>
                    <li>Control usage problems – improper toolbar or entry field usage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Exercise the application or web site under controlled test conditions with representative users. Data
                will be used to access whether usability goals regarding an effective, efficient, and well-received user
                interface have been achieved.</li>
            <li>Establish baseline user performance and user-satisfaction levels of the user interface for future
                usability evaluations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="fill-in" id="user-group">The project is intended for general web users. Four Humber College students
            participated in testing. All sessions were done in person using a laptop between Nov 25–26, 2025.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p class="fill-in" id="details">This usability test evaluated the Day & Night Garden project focusing on
            day/night transition, sun/moon interactions, animated elements, and window lights. Overall, users enjoyed
            the animation but had trouble discovering interactive elements. Recommendations include improving
            discoverability, feedback, and light guidance.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p class="fill-in" id="methodology">Four participants completed 10–15 minute sessions on a laptop. A prepared
            script was used. Data collected included task success, time on task, errors, confusion points, and user
            comments.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
        <h2>Participants</h2>
        <p class="fill-in" id="number-participants">Four participants were Tested. All were regular web users with basic
            computer skills. No prior animation experience required.
        </p>
        <p class="fill-in" id="selection">Participants were selected informally from classmates/ Friends who were
            comfortable using websites but had not seen the project before.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p class="fill-in" id="training">No training was provided. Participants only received a general explanation of
            the purpose of the usability test to accurately measure natural first-time interactions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p class="fill-in" id="procedure">Each participant used a laptop in person. The facilitator followed the script:
            intro - background questions - homepage tour - tasks - wrap-up. While Testing I used notes to write down
            experience.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
        <h2>Usability Tasks</h2>
        <p class="fill-in" id="task-1">Tasks were derived from core interactions: triggering day/night transition,
            interacting with sun/moon, observing ambient elements, and toggling window lights.
        </p>
        <p class="fill-in" id="task-2">Participants were asked to explore the scene, find how to change time of day,
            interact with the sky/sun/moon, and toggle house windows. Tasks represent typical user behavior.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
        <h2>Usability Metrics</h2>
        <p>Usability metrics refers to user performance measured against specific performance goals necessary to satisfy
            usability requirements. Scenario completion success rates, adherence to dialog scripts, error rates, and
            subjective evaluations will be used. Time-to-completion of scenarios will also be collected.</p>

        <h2>Scenario Completion</h2>
        <p>Each scenario will require, or request, that the participant obtains or inputs specific data that would be
            used in course of a typical task. The scenario is completed when the participant indicates the scenario's
            goal has been obtained (whether successfully or unsuccessfully) or the participant requests and receives
            sufficient guidance as to warrant scoring the scenario as a critical error.</p>

        <p class="fill-in">The main metrics used were: scenario completion, error type, time on task, and user comments.
        </p>
        <h2>Critical Errors</h2>
        <p>Critical errors are deviations at completion from the targets of the scenario. Obtaining or otherwise
            reporting of the wrong data value due to participant workflow is a critical error. Participants may or may
            not be aware that the task goal is incorrect or incomplete.</p>

        <p>Independent completion of the scenario is a universal goal; help obtained from the other usability test roles
            is cause to score the scenario a critical error. Critical errors can also be assigned when the participant
            initiates (or attempts to initiate) and action that will result in the goal state becoming unobtainable. In
            general, critical errors are unresolved errors during the process of completing the task or errors that
            produce an incorrect outcome.</p>

        <h2>Non-critical Errors</h2>
        <p>Non-critical errors are errors that are recovered from by the participant or, if not detected, do not result
            in processing problems or unexpected results. Although non-critical errors can be undetected by the
            participant, when they are detected they are generally frustrating to the participant.</p>

        <p>These errors may be procedural, in which the participant does not complete a scenario in the most optimal
            means (e.g., excessive steps and keystrokes). These errors may also be errors of confusion (ex., initially
            selecting the wrong function, using a user-interface control incorrectly such as attempting to edit an
            un-editable field).</p>

        <p>Noncritical errors can always be recovered from during the process of completing the scenario. Exploratory
            behavior, such as opening the wrong menu while searching for a function, will be coded as a non-critical
            error.</p>

        <h2>Subjective Evaluations</h2>
        <p>Subjective evaluations regarding ease of use and satisfaction will be collected via questionnaires, and
            during debriefing at the conclusion of the session. The questionnaires will utilize free-form responses and
            rating scales.</p>

        <h2>Scenario Completion Time (time on task)</h2>
        <p>The time to complete each scenario, not including subjective evaluation durations, will be recorded.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">
        <h2>Usability Goals</h2>
        <p>The next section describes the usability goals.</p>

        <h2>Completion Rate</h2>
        <p>Completion rate is the percentage of test participants who successfully complete the task without critical
            errors. A critical error is defined as an error that results in an incorrect or incomplete outcome. In other
            words, the completion rate represents the percentage of participants who, when they are finished with the
            specified task, have an "output" that is correct. Note: If a participant requires assistance in order to
            achieve a correct output then the task will be scored as a critical error and the overall completion rate
            for the task will be affected.</p>

        <p>A completion rate of <span class="fill-in" id="completion-rate">98%</span> is the
            goal for each task in this usability test.</p>

        <h2>Error-free rate</h2>
        <p>Error-free rate is the percentage of test participants who complete the task without any errors (critical or
            non-critical errors). A non-critical error is an error that would not have an impact on the final output of
            the task but would result in the task being completed less efficiently.</p>

        <p>An error-free rate of <span class="fill-in" id="error-rate">80%</span> is the goal
            for each task in this usability test.</p>

        <h2>Time on Task (TOT)</h2>
        <p>The time to complete a scenario is referred to as "time on task". It is measured from the time the person
            begins the scenario to the time he/she signals completion.</p>

        <h2>Subjective Measures</h2>
        <p>Subjective opinions about specific tasks, time to perform each task, features, and functionality will be
            surveyed. At the end of the test, participants will rate their satisfaction with the overall system.
            Combined with the interview/debriefing session, these data are used to assess attitudes of the participants.

        <h2>Problem Severity</h2>
        <p>To prioritize recommendations, a method of problem severity classification will be used in the analysis of
            the data collected during evaluation activities. The approach treats problem severity as a combination of
            two factors - the impact of the problem and the frequency of users experiencing the problem during the
            evaluation.</p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>Impact is the ranking of the consequences of the problem by defining the level of impact that the problem has
            on successful task completion. There are three levels of impact:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>High - prevents the user from completing the task (critical error)</li>
            <li>Moderate - causes user difficulty but the task can be completed (non-critical error)</li>
            <li>Low - minor problems that do not significantly affect the task completion (non-critical error)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequency</h2>
        <p>Frequency is the percentage of participants who experience the problem when working on a task.</p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>High: 30% or more of the participants experience the problem</li>
            <li>Moderate: 11% - 29% of participants experience the problem</li>
            <li>Low: 10% or fewer of the participants experience the problem</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Problem Severity Classification</h2>
        <p>The identified severity for each problem implies a general reward for resolving it, and a general risk for
            not addressing it, in the current release.</p>

        <p><strong>Severity 1</strong> - High impact problems that often prevent a user from correctly completing a
            task. They occur in varying frequency and are characteristic of calls to the Help Desk. Reward for
            resolution is typically exhibited in fewer Help Desk calls and reduced redevelopment costs.</p>

        <p><strong>Severity 2</strong> - Moderate to high frequency problems with moderate to low impact are typical of
            erroneous actions that the participant recognizes needs to be undone. Reward for resolution is typically
            exhibited in reduced time on task and decreased training costs.</p>

        <p><strong>Severity 3</strong> - Either moderate problems with low frequency or low problems with moderate
            frequency; these are minor annoyance problems faced by a number of participants. Reward for resolution is
            typically exhibited in reduced time on task and increased data integrity.</p>

        <p><strong>Severity 4</strong> - Low impact problems faced by few participants; there is low risk to not
            resolving these problems. Reward for resolution is typically exhibited in increased user satisfaction.</p>

        <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
        <section id="solutions">

            <p>
                Based on the usability findings and the collected data from four participants, the following solutions
                are
                recommended to improve the usability and overall user experience of the Day &amp; Night Garden animation
                project.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Improve Discoverability of Interactive Elements</h3>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Users did not immediately recognize which elements were clickable, especially the
                sky area and the house windows.</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add hover effects (e.g., glow, scale-up, or slight outline) to interactive elements such as the sun,
                    moon, sky trigger area, and windows.</li>
                <li>Ensure all clickable elements use <code>cursor: pointer;</code> to indicate interactivity.</li>
                <li>Add a subtle first-time hint such as: “Click the sky or house to explore animations.”</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Strengthen Visual Feedback for Window Light Toggle</h3>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Window lights turning on/off were too subtle and not easily noticed by
                participants.</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase brightness and contrast for the “lights on” state.</li>
                <li>Add a gentle glow animation when the lights toggle to draw attention.</li>
                <li>Optionally display a temporary label such as “Lights On” or “Lights Off” that fades out after one
                    second.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Provide Clear Context or Description</h3>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Some users were unsure about the purpose of the project (demo, game, or visual
                experiment).</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a small heading under the scene: “Day &amp; Night Garden – Interactive CSS Animation.”</li>
                <li>Include a short description: “Click around the scene to explore animations and transitions.”</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Add Light Guidance Without Cluttering the Interface</h3>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong> First-time users benefited from slight hints but too much text could clutter the
                visual design.</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a short on-screen tooltip that disappears automatically after a few seconds.</li>
                <li>Hide hints after the first interaction so repeat users experience a clean interface.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Support Varied Screen Sizes and Accessibility</h3>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Current testing was on laptop devices only; smaller screens or reduced contrast
                might affect usability.</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure clickable areas remain large enough on smaller mobile screens.</li>
                <li>Improve color contrast on interactive elements to support accessibility guidelines.</li>
                <li>Consider adding alternative text or ARIA labels for key interactive elements.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Implementing these solutions will enhance the discoverability of key interactions, improve user
                feedback,
                and provide a more intuitive experience for first-time users while keeping the design visually clean and
                engaging.
